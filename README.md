# generator-simple [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/robdodson/generator-simple.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robdodson/generator-simple)

A tiny [Yeoman][] generator for quickly sketching ideas.


## Getting Started

1. Install the generator by running: `npm install -g generator-simple`
2. Run: `yo simple`
3. Run: `grunt` to start a LiveReload server on port `9000`


## What's Included

The simple generator contains an `index.html`, a `main.css` and a `main.js`. There's also a LiveReload server so you can see your changes quickly.


## Why such a simple generator?

After I run a generator, I typically need to go in to tweak some things or rearrange the structure a bit. In some instances there's a ton of stuff being installed that I don't actually care about. I wanted to make something that would help me quickly prototype ideas without a bunch of cruft.
